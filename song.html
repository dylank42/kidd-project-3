        [Intro]
        (Love)<br />

        [Verse 1]<br />
        Love, do you want love? Do you want lust?<br />
        Say you don't know<br />
        Maybe you just like the control, like it all cold<br />
        But I like ya, like ya like you're drugs<br />
        Sit in my blood, maybe too much, never enough<br />
        I am your dog, I'm on your floor, all that you want<br />
        But I like ya, like ya like you're (drugs)<br />
        <br />
        [Pre-Chorus 1]<br />
        You get all worked up<br />
        Loving you, but it's not enough<br />
        Loving you from the airlock of<br />
        Your heart, from airlock one<br />
        Fear pulls you from my arms<br />
        It's a reckless abandon<br />
        One look and it's all gone<br />
        All the air from the bottom of my lungs<br />
        <br />

        [Chorus]<br />
        Water, running down my face<br />
        Water, running different ways<br />
        Water, like a billion waves<br />
        Water, just a tear in space<br />
        Water, running down my face<br />
        Water, running different ways<br />
        Water, like a billion waves<br />
        Water, just a tear in space<br />
    </p>
